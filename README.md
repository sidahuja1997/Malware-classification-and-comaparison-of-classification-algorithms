# Malware-classification-and-comaparison-of-classification-algorithms
This project is an attempt to compare various classification algorithms for their accuracy on a dataset of malwares.

The dataset includes a number of malware and benign files and has 55 attributes among which features selection is performed and classification 
if performed.

Various algorithms are tested and the one with the highest score is used for predicting classification results.

The algorithms are RandomForest Classification, DecisionTree classification, Gaussian NaiveBayes classification, AdaBoost, Gausian Boost, LinearRegression

Following are the modules required for this project: 


pandas pip install pandas
numpy pip install numpy
pickle pip install pickle
scipy pip install scipy
scikit pip install -U scikit-learn
